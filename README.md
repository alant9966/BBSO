# BBSO
IDL code for BBSO camera testing.

Test data should be taken in a specific order: <br>
First, images should be taken at constant exposure intervals in increasing order. <br>
Then, the corresponding darks should be taken at the same exposures, also in increasing order. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. 0.5 ms img, 1 ms img, 1.5 ms img, 0.5 ms dark, 1 ms dark, 1.5 ms dark <br>
Make sure the FITS files in the folder are organized in this order. <br>
